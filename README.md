# Minimal Example of Tutorial as README

This [`README.md`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/minimal-example-readme/blob/main/README.md) illustrates all **required** metadata used by [`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub).

## Metadata

| Markdown YAML front matter key | Required | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| title | | The first `<h1>` section heading. |
| subtitle | | Not supported. |
| author | | Retrieve from latest Git commit information. |
| image | | Must be `cover.jpg`. |
| image-alt | | Not supported. |

## Supported Features

[`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub) uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com) uses [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) to convert Markdown to HTML. Because Quarto and GFM are not 100% compatible, we provide a comparison of features in the next table.
