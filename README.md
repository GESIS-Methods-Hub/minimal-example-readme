This [`README.md`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/minimal-example-readme/blob/main/README.md) shows all **required** metadata used by [`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub).

## Supported Features

[`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub) uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com) uses [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) to convert Markdown to HTML. Because Quarto and GFM are not 100% compatible, we provide a comparison of features in the next table.
